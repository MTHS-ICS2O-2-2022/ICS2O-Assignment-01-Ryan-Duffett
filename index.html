            Guido Van Rassum is a Dutch programmer who is known as the creator
            of the Python coding language. During December 1989, he was bored
            and wanted to start a coding project to keep him occupied during
            Christmas. Since his office was closed, he started work on the
            coding language Python. He finished his work 3 years later. He was
            born in the Netherlands in 1965, and is now 67 years old. He
            received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from
            the University of Amsterdam in 1982, which helped him in his coding
            journey. Later on in life, he worked at Google from 2005 to 2012,
            where he spent half of his time developing Python. ----
